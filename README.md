# Reddit Account Generator with Tor Proxy
 **WHAT IS IT?**
 
 This is a semi-automatic Reddit account generator. I'm saying "semi-automatic" because it still requires a Google Captcha to be completed at the end of the creation process.
 
 **HOW DO USE?**

  1. Start Tor Browser and Connect.
  2. Change EMAIL in accounts.py to your email. #If you use GMAIL, you can add dots to make infinite accounts for one mail. Example: Instead of example@gmail.com, use    ex.ample@gmail.com. ex.ample@gmail.com will work for infinite accounts!
 3. Start accounts.py.
 4. Solve Captcha and Register. 
 5. Success!
