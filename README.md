# Reddit Account Generator
 **WHAT IS IT?**
 
 This is a semi-automatic Reddit account generator. I'm saying "semi-automatic" because it still requires a Google Captcha to be completed at the end of the creation process.
 
 **HOW DO USE?**

 1. Start Tor Browser and connect.
 2. Start namesforreddit.py.
 3. Success!
 
 **REQUIRMENTS**
 
 Selenium 3.14.0 (**NOT** Selenium 4!) => pip install selenium==3.14.0

 Webdriver => pip install webdriver-manager

 Tor Browser => https://www.torproject.org/download/

 File named "namesforreddit.txt"
